## Chapter 7 
By making bets, it eliminates the time energy put towards backlogs. Creating backlogs requires using extra time and resources for the upkeep of the backlogs. Before a six-week cycle a betting table is held. The betting table process is used to pitch ideas and decide on what feature to take on in the upcoming cycle. The betting table meetings are short, infrequent, and insanely productive. The meeting only lasts an hour to two hours and pitches have to be well-prepared. The practice of betting consists of not holding on to old ideas. It is about shaping a feature that is needed at the time. If a feature is still needed and is considered too good to pass up, it must be reshaped and pitched at the betting table. This is done independently so no need for separate resources to upkeep the backlog. The betting table promotes relevancy, ideas being timely, and of the moment. 

## Chapter 8 
The betting table process is done for a six week cycle. The number six was chosen as it was the sweet spot of not being too long and not being too short. A lot of teams use the sprint method, but this is seen as not enough time to complete a full feature. So, meetings are frequent but without having a finished product, therefore being a waste of resources. With the six week cycle, programmers are able to start and finish a feature and not be interrupted within this time. The six-week cycle are also not back to back. Between each cycle, a two-week cool down period is held. During this time, programmers can work on bug fixes as well sa do their work on their own time and schedule. 

The betting table is held during the cool down period. The meeting lasts from an hour to two hours and the output must be a cycle plan. The headcount of the meeting is low to avoid over-discussing a decision. And the options are well-shaped. This avoids wasting time on unnecessary information. 

The betting process is called a bet because it sets a different expectation. A pitch defines a specific payout that makes a bet worth making. By making a bet, the programmers feel that this is a commitment. This is something that must be done without interruption. The six-week cycle is also beneficial because in the worst case scenario, if a bet does not turn out well the team only loses six weeks of their time. The cycle avoids getting stuck in a rabbit hole for longer than six weeks. 

The cycle is done on a non-interrupted time basis. When a team is assigned to a feature they cannot be assigned to any other tasks. Their sole goal for the six-week cycle is to make a finished product that can be shipped at the end of the cycle. The cycle is all about moment and progress, similar to growth and acceleration. The team cannot step away to do bug fixes and other tasks. This makes the team lose momentum. And if the wrong hour is chosen that can kill a day and losing a day can kill a week. Once again, the longest another team has to wait is a week. 

If a project does not finish, it does not get an extension. This is a risk that can occur. But the cycle is done so there are no runaway projects. The pitch was made to define an appetite and that is where the bet was placed. It would be foolish to then extend the timeline and now put two or three times the original bet timeline. This is known as a circuit breaker. If a project does not finish that means the original pitch was not correctly made. This then means the pitch must be reshaped and has to go through the betting table again. The circuit breaker motivates the team to take ownership of the project they are working on. It gives them the responisobo;oty to make trade offs during implementation and choosing where to cut scope. You can’t ship a feature without making hard decisions and know where to stop and compromise. The six week cycle is a hard deadline that makes the team to regularly question their design. 
All software has bugs, this is unavoidable. This is what the cool down periods are for. A cycle will only be halted during a big crisis but this does not happen often. A true crisis is something like data being lost, the app is down, etc. If there is not enough time during the cool down period, a yearly bug smash is held during the end of the year. 

It is important to keep the slate clean. This is done by only having one bet and one cycle at a time. Work is never reused unless it is reshaped and reconsidered as a new bet. This is because every cycle you are learning something new. You are learning what is working and what is not, what is important and what is not. This means your pitch shall surely change and be reshaped. If a feature is expected to take longer than six weeks it must be reshaped to fix a six week cycle. If the feature is still worth it and will take longer this will be decided for the next cycle. 

## Chapter 9 
If a product already exists the company is just going through the motions of shaping, betting, and a six week cycle. A new product has three modes it can be in. The first stage is R&D mode. During this stage, only seniors are on the team. The main objective of this stage is to make the majority of the architectural decisions so the team can start delegating. The team only consists of seniors because it is vital at this stage that a group of people must understand the vision of the product and be able to judge the long term design. The R&D stage has multiple cycles and shipment is not expected at the end. After the first cycle, they might find out that the company is not ready to tackle the product. 

Production mode is what comes after R&D. This is where the team of seniors bring in other people to contribute. The production mode is organized in formal cycles. The shaping of the product is deliberate. In this stage, it is possible to have bets in parallel. The goal of this step is to ship, but shipping in this stage means pushing into the main codebase. Before launch, there is a possibility for features to be removed. This is done during the final cleanup held right before launch. The cleanup should not last longer than two weeks. 
 
Questions that should be asked during the betting table includes: 
*Does the problem matter? 
-Is there a way to narrow it down so we can get 80% of the benefit from 20% of the change?*
*Is the appetite right?
-Sometimes you have to ask more questions when making your pitch.
-Ask seniors how they would feel if it can be done in two weeks.
-If they say they don’t want to add another dependency that is fair.
*Is the solution attractive? 
-A few points of disagreement about the solution may come up during pitch.
*Is it the right time?
-Has it been too long since a splash of news with a new feature has been made?
-Have there been too many updates on one feature recently?
*Are the right people available?
