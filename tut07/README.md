## Daily Scrum Summary

Before a daily scrum can occur a sprint must be in session. A sprint time-box is held within a time span of a month or less. This is due to the amount of work assigned. A sprint consists of sprint planning, daily scrums, development work, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. This time is done for consistent inspection as well as limit risk within a maximum time of one month. 

During the sprint planning stage, discussions are held to decide on what work is to be performed during the sprint. This decision is done with the entire scrum team and can last a maximum of eight hours. Questions that need to be answered include: what can be delivered in increments resulting from the upcoming sprint? And how will he work needed to deliver the increments?

The planning includes what can be done. The development team will focus on how to forecast the functionality. And the product owner will set the overall objective of the sprint. The whole scrum team must understand what needs to be done in the upcoming sprint. 

When a sprint has begun, a daily scrum is held at the same time and place every day. The daily scrum lasts for 15-minutes and plans the work for the next 24 hours. This meeting is to optimize the collaboration of the team and their performance by having consistent inspections. 

During the meeting, the dev team has the ability to inspect each other’s progress towards the overall goal. In turn, optimizes the probability of the team’s success. It is a meeting where everyone can understand how to work better together, and better organize themselves and their work. A few questions that may be discussed is: what did I do yesterday, what will I do today, and do I see any issues that prevent me or the team from reaching our goal?

The scrum master is responsible for the team having the meeting but the dev team is responsible for conducting the meeting. The scrum master must also teach the team to keep the meeting within 15 minutes. Overall, daily scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, and promote quick decision-making. The short meeting also allows the overall dev team to be well aware of the project quickly. It is an important inspect and adapt meeting that will help the team succeed in the long run.


## Chapter 13 – Showing Progress Summary

A great way to represent a team’s progress is through a hill chart. A to-do list can be difficult to keep track of scopes as it is not as simple as checking tasks off a list. The way a hill chart organizes tasks is through what is known and what is unknown. This allows the team to gain more context on the scope and better understand what tasks are coming. This new metric of what is unknown and known is also more accurate because numeric measurements are vague and do not work for tasks that the team is new to. 

A hill chart is divided into two parts, the first half is the uphill and is where tasks that are unknown sit; and the second half is the downhill and is where the tasks that are known and on its way to completion sit. The uphill stage consists of uncertainty of scopes, it is unknown, and involves a lot of problem solving. The downhill portion is marked by certainty, confidence, and knowing what to do. 

It is still possible to be stuck on the hill. If it is seen that a scope is not making it past the hill this could mean the scope is far too big and has too many uncertainties. When this occurs, a scope must be reconsidered and can possibly be split into smaller scopes. With smaller scopes, the risk of uncertainty lessens and increases the possibility of the scope making it up the hill.

The hill chart can also be used to sequence tasks. Some scopes are riskier than others. When this occurs it is important to prioritize tasks that are scarier. Work often expands to fill the time available. Therefore, it is important to begin with a task that has the most uncertainties and unknowns. By doing this, you are able to give yourself more time to smooth out the kinks and leave the tasks most routine or least worrisome for last. By the end of the cycle, the team should have finished the more important tasks.
