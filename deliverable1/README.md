## Problem
The main use of a dashboard is to have a comprehensive overview of the data from different sources. The dashboard needs to be easy to use and should be easy for users to get the information they need quickly. The current problem is that the dashboard is static. The components are one size and there is currently a lot of scrolling to get to the needed information.Therefore the problem at hand is, how can this process be more streamlined?

## Appetite
The main focus for this upcoming cycle is to make the dashboard dynamic. The new features will include resizable and movable components. Creating additional components should not be done during this cycle. Making any changes on the individual components should not be worked on during this cycle. 

## Solution
The current issue with the current dashboard is that it is static. The dashboard must be an easy overview of the all the manufacturing data. The current process involves a lot of scrolling to get any desired information. This process must be streamlined for a better workflow. The solution is to make the overview of the data more accessible. This will be done with dynamic components. The components must be resizable and movable. This will allow for easy customization to create a layout that best fits the current data the user needs.

This is an image of the breadboarding for the new feature.

## Rabbit Holes
A potential rabbit hole of this feature would be getting caught up in the individual components. The components of the dashboard have already been worked on and finalized. The current feature is to improve the overall dashboard, not the individual components. We would not want to get into a rabbit hole of bugs looking into the individual components.
