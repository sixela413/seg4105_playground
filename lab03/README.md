## Shaping: High-Level Description

My feature is an improvement based on our Dashboard view. Our capstone project includes a supervisor view that allows them to see an overview of tags, maps, and anchor status. The current dashboard is super stationary and isnâ€™t as dynamic as we would like. The feature will improve the dynamicness of the dashboard. This will include being able to grab and drag the dashboard components to edit their size to fit what is needed for the time. Having a dynamic and robust dashboard will improve the working process of the supervisors so they can work more streamlined.
