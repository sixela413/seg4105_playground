## Writing a Pitch Summary 

The podcast begins with explaining to the audience what a pitch is and what it is used for. A pitch is used when making a new feature. A pitch is used as a direction for the team. A pitch does 
not need to include full details. The pitch is the overall idea that the team will be after. The pitch should be in eight hundred words or less and can include a few mockups and/or diagrams. This will then be given to the team and the team will turn it into actual working code. 

The shape-up method is always about finding the correct amount of abstraction. The pitch should not be overly detailed nor can it be too vague. If it is too detailed, it can lead the team down the wrong path and they will get too hung up on the pitch being a set of instructions. If the pitch is too vague the team will not have to correct the amount of information to fully understand where they can cut or proceed. A pitch also cannot be overly specified because a situation cannot be fully known until the process is in motion. Roadblocks will always be encountered. Which is why the pitch needs to have wiggle room where the team can problem solve. The more you proceed with the motions the more you will uncover. The pitch relies more on budget. The pitch gives the team an allotted time. The time in place is the budget. Therefore, once the team has begun you should trust that they will make the right decisions to stay within the allotted budget. 

Before formalizing a pitch, anyone can throw out their ideas. The formalized pitch is what has been decided on through sifting through the ideas. The pitch is an attempt at the solution. It is not to outwrite the instructions to solve the problem. People who work on formalizing the pitch must already know the context of the project. The pitch is to explain the potential solution and not the execution. The execution is done by the developers. The execution is not explained because you do not know all the information up front. For example, a pitch can give you a direction for the next two weeks but eventually the team will veer off. Since the team knows the allotted budget they will know how to problem solve and what shortcuts to make to reach the budget. 

The pitch promotes employee satisfaction: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The pitch is gratifying work in all steps of the process. The process of pitches also avoids falling into rabbit holes. Rabbit holes are what can put teams into a slippery slope. This is why a pitchâ€™s main focus is on budget because the team will know not to fall into a rabbit hole.
