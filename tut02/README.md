## Chapter 2 

The shape-up method revolves around having the right level of abstraction. This means not being too vague nor being too concrete. The downsides of being too concrete is not leaving any room for creativity to the designers and programmers. For example, if you present a high-fidelity mockup but tell the designers and programmers that they donâ€™t have to follow it, this will not be the case. A high-fidelity mockup sets a bias, and will make it difficult for the team to stray away from the design you presented. Delivering ideas through words can be vague. This leaves too much room for uncertainty and questioning. Shaping is creative and integrative. Shaping is best done by someone who is a generalist. They will ask the big questions such as what are we trying to solve, why does it matter, etc. These types of questions will drive the team to get to the root of a problem. By getting to the root of a problem, it will make the solution much more clear cut and will be able to fit in a six-week timeframe.

## Chapter 3

An important criteria to keep in mind so a project fits into a six-week timeframe is to set boundaries. Building a feature always starts with a raw idea, but sometimes excitement about a feature can cloud judgment on whether it is actually feasible. Setting an appetite is a time budget. This can be done in small batches or big batches. The difference between the two batches are the timelines. A small batch is done in six week intervals. Whereas a big batch is done within the full six weeks. An appetite starts with a number and ends with a design. It is a creative constraint on a design process. Setting a fixed deadline allows for pressure on the team to make trade-offs. A deadline removes the thought that every feature is feasible and can be done. This is dangerous because a lot of time, money, and resources can be wasted. When responding to raw ideas, you should not make a commitment without knowing all of the uncertainties, which is why you should respond with a soft no. By responding in this way, you can discuss the topic further at a later time to get a better idea on if the feature is worth the time. To put boundaries in place you need all three criterias: a raw idea, setting an appetite, and then narrowing the problem definition. 

## Chapter 4

To find the elements needed for a project you can use strategies such as breadboarding and fat marker sketches. Breadboarding is when you sketch key components and connections of interfaces without specifying a particular design by using shorthand. Breadboarding includes components such as places, affordances, and connection lines. Places are the things users can navigate to, screens, dialogues, and menus. Affordances are the things users can act on. The connection lines are how the affordances take users from place to place. The breadboarding technique is done by using words instead of pictures. The fat marker sketches are self-explanatory, it is a strategy done with a fat marker. The benefit of doing a sketch with a fat marker is to not be too detailed. This also helps with not jumping ahead to a detail specific idea when the field has not been surveyed enough. These strategies are done to leave room for designers. 

## Chapter 5

Holes are needed to be found in features during the design phase. This is to prevent the loss of money, time, and resources. Holes can be logical inconsistencies or ambiguities that will bottleneck the team and prevent them from meeting a deadline. It is important to set the boundaries of the features to make sure the design team does not go overboard and take too much on their plate. Parts of the solution are still able to be cut out. During the sketching phase, it is a low-risk time to cut back on features.
